while (dist_to_gate > x | cannot see full gate)
	while (cannot see gate)
		rotate
	read vector from CV
	move along X and Y until near 0
	while (within tolerance of x and y and dist_to_gate > x)
		move to gate
		
move through gate (forward)
break		

New algo:

while ((can see gate and dist_to_gate > x) | can't see gate (no data))
	while (cannot see gate)
		rotate
	while (can see gate)
		read gate's pose from CV
		move to gate's pose

move through gate (forward)
break		

Second algo assumes that robot is never at a steep angle to the gate. This is likely a fair assumption as we start approximately in line with the gate's normal vector.
